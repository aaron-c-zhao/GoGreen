## Sprint retrospective:

Nik
- Problems encountered:
Uploading profile pictures to the server is still a mess. Otherwise not so much. We are done after all.
- Adjustments for next sprint:
There is not next sprint. Unless the presentation is meant. In that case my plan is to answer all question posed to me. (I won't be presenting)
- Adjustments from previous sprint:
While I haven't been ultra-productive this week, I did get a decent amount of work done, and I think my job is even done. I did fare much better this week in terms of mental health.

Gio
- Problems encountered:
Slight changes had to be done in database trigger maintenance
- Adjustments for next sprint:
Full time will be put into understanding the project as a whole and more intricately the database so that I can effectively answer any questions posed to me
- Adjustments from previous sprint:
Exams and presentation are taking up almost all time for the project, very few changes to make

Jan
- Problems encountered:
Not much, besides the stress from learning other subjects.
- Adjustments for next sprint:
There wonâ€™t be any future Sprint anymore. Slowly working on the preparation for the presentation.
- Adjustments from previous sprint:
Learned the exams well and focused less on the project.

Rahul
- Blocking issues - none
- Adjustments from last sprint - learned more about flutter and dart which helped being more organized and minimized wastage of time 
- Adjustments for next sprint - not valid since this is the last

Zhao
- Blocking issues:
None
- Improvement from the previous sprint:
Not much work to do for this week so no improvement.
- Adjustment for the next Sprint:
There is no next sprint in this project, so no adjustment. 

Atanas
- Problems  Encountered : As this week I haven't encountered any new material, I was not having any blocking issues.  
- Adjustments for previous/next sprint : -

Alin
- Problems encountered: Sometimes having to spend a bit more time than I imagined for goals, but they are simply done. No issue encountered while finishing my tasks, it just worked out nicely.
