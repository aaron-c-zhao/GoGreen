week 8
demo 3 presentation:

	Zhao shows presentation, client works fine
	TA asks why we use floats.
	TA asks for pannekoeken (in the app)
	
	*Program crashes at adding new activity*
	500 error
	TA goes away
	500 error is issued due to duplicate primary key: server auto-increments the primary id, that somehow got messed up due to manually inserted tuples?
	
	TA is back
	
	demo 3 continues
	ta asks about icon
	ta asks to add unit to activity history sidebar
	ta asks to sort achievements on achieval 
	ta likes the amount of visual feedback
	let your mom use the app to get more feedback
	to focus on
		more process
		bonus features
			calculate saved $
			plant a tree
	
	don't use andy as pfp
	amount of earned / lost points:
		hard to say, estimate ~8, but no promises
		but keep this up and you will pass.	
		
	suggestions for presentation:
		Present app live, but keep a video backup
		q&a will be about your design choices.
		biggest coders should be not presenters.
		avoid 2 people talking during q&a.
	
	
	draft report deadline: thursday.
	mock presentation: monday.
	ethics chapter: enought to write.
	make sure master is clean.
	checkstyle does not apply to mobile app.
	app being in dart is not an issue.
	this may be even a extra bonus point.
	
	we are somewhat ahead compared to other groups.
