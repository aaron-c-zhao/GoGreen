Decisions made:
1. Due to no longer using a third API, we have decided to use the database to conduct our calculations
2. The MySQL database with full calculation functionality is nearly complete, and is currently ready for implementation into the main project
- Giovanni will be in charge of database development, and Rahul and Jan will now be responsible for connecting it to the server-side code
3. Test coverage is still being developed and the % coverage is still not ideal. Alin and Nik will be taking up this task to raise the code coverage

Discussion:
1. Database
- MySQL triggers are being used for calculations, we have decided to make the triggers non-filtering (i.e. assume perfect input parameters from the server side) 
- Establish only a few tables for the server communication, the rest being record keeping and calculation
- Extensive testing done on the database triggers will have to be done, as now all our calculations and record keeping will rely on them
- Future implementation of more features (solar panels, tree planting, etc.) will require a more complex schema and further design on the database design, which Gio will be developing for the following weeks
2. Testing
- Alin has chosen to take up the task of most of the testing, along with some help from Nik
- Jacoco will be used for much of our server testing
- This will be set as a priority for us, as falling behind on testing could potentially result in us developing on bugged code
3. GUI design
- We have decided to add statistics features to the application, which show your personal statistics on opening the app
- Atanas is the main GUI developer along with help from Zhao (to connect the client to the server)
- Jan will supplement the client side development along with connection to the server 
4. Linking GUI
- Only still partially developed, but just enough so that other dependent tasks can continue tasks
- Jan will continue to work on this, with the Database now making the calculations this adds one more that information needs to go through to get to the GUI
5. Misc.
- Much work will need to be done this week in preparation for the demo coming up. All the features must be extensively tested both manually and through Jacoco and Alin's other specialist debugging and testing tools
